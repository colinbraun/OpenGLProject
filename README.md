# OpenGLProject
An OpenGL project for the purpose of learning

To build, generate a glfw.lib file (source or binary can be found at https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
Note: It is probably best to download the source package and create the lib file with CMake, not sure if binaries work.

Replace the current glfw.lib in the Libraries directory with the new one.

Open the solution in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (earlier version may work).
Build the solution and run.
